This is my personal vim-setup. Some of this stuff is inspired by
[denschub/vimconfig](https://github.com/denschub/vimconfig) - you should check this out, too.

# Installation
You should have a working VIM 7.2 or up. :-D


# Stuff, I use in my VIM/GVIM
* [Conque](http://code.google.com/p/conque/): A plugin which allows to run programs (a bash for example) in a vim-buffer.
* [NERD_tree](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=273): A alternative File-Browser for VIM.
* [statusline](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3734): A better/nicer statusline with some extra features.
* [taglist](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=273): A easy to use TAG jump list.
* [eclim](http://eclim.org/): A Server which gives VIM the functionality of Eclipse and in addition made VIM usable as native editor in eclipse.
* [matchit](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=39): A plugin which extends the % command.
* [snipMate](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2540): A plugin which extends VIM with snippet functionality.
* [surround](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1697): A plugin which changes surroundings in seconds.

You should read the docs for that stuff. :)
