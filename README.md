This is my personal vim-setup. A lot of the stuff is copied/inspired by
[carlhuda/janus](https://github.com/carlhuda/janus) - you should check
this out, too.

# Installation

You should have a working vim. Also you should install `rake` and
`ruby-dev` to make my installation-script working.

If you have installed that stuff you can run
`curl https://raw.github.com/denschub/vimconfig/master/install.sh -o - | sh`
